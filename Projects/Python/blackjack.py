
#   This project is an attempt at creating blackjack from scratch. It contains a full deck of cards where cards are pulled 
#   out of the deck after being drawn like a real game, has a working betting and chip system which follows blackjack rules, 
#   has a working dealer and player and uses player inputs to make decisions, has a doubling system and a basic split function.
